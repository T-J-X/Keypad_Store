For local Vendure development, always use `localhost` for Admin UI and APIs (for example `http://localhost:3000/admin`, `http://localhost:3000/admin-api`, and `http://localhost:3000/shop-api`) and do not mix `localhost` with `127.0.0.1` in browser URLs or env vars, because host mismatches can prevent `vendure-auth` cookies from being sent and make Admin UI sessions appear unauthorized.
