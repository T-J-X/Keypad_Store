# 2026-02-22 SEO Audit

Scope:
- Metadata + canonical/noindex coverage in `app/` routes
- `robots.ts` and `sitemap.ts`
- Structured data components

## Metadata Consistency

Status: consistent after remediation.

What is in place:
- Root metadata base is configured in `/Users/terry/keypad-store/apps/frontend/app/layout.tsx`.
- Canonical coverage exists on major routes including:
  - Home (`/`)
  - Shop listing via `generateMetadata` canonical logic
  - Product pages via `generateMetadata` canonical logic
  - Legal pages (`/privacy`, `/terms`, `/cookies`)
- Sensitive utility/auth flows are noindexed:
  - `/cart`, `/checkout`, `/account`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/order/[code]`.

Implemented in follow-up:
- Explicit canonical alternates are present on marketing/static pages (`/about`, `/careers`, `/contact`, `/docs`, `/guides`).
- Page-level metadata titles were normalized to avoid duplicate suffixes while preserving layout-level `%s | VCT` formatting.

## Canonical + Noindex Rules

Implemented and verified:
- `robots: { index: false, follow: false }` present on non-public utility/auth/order routes.
- Shop and product canonical generation accounts for section/category slug context and product canonical overrides.

Risk to monitor:
- Canonical override values sourced from product custom fields should be validated in content ops to avoid malformed external canonicals.

## Robots + Sitemap Correctness

### robots
File: `/Users/terry/keypad-store/apps/frontend/app/robots.ts`

Current behavior:
- Allows crawl for public content.
- Disallows account/auth/cart/checkout/order and API paths.
- Publishes sitemap location and host.

Assessment:
- Correct direction for commerce + authenticated routes.
- Good protection against indexing transactional/private pages.

### sitemap
File: `/Users/terry/keypad-store/apps/frontend/app/sitemap.ts`

Current behavior:
- Includes high-value static pages and deduplicated product URLs.
- Uses hourly revalidation pattern (`revalidate = 3600`).

Assessment:
- Structurally correct and indexable.
- Product URL inclusion is strong.

Recommendation:
- Consider splitting into sitemap index + segmented sitemaps if URL count grows (products, docs/guides, programmatic pages).

## Structured Data Validation Approach

Implemented:
- Site-level JSON-LD in `/Users/terry/keypad-store/apps/frontend/components/SiteJsonLd.tsx` (server-rendered script).
- Product-level JSON-LD in `/Users/terry/keypad-store/apps/frontend/components/ProductPdp/ProductJsonLd.tsx` (server-rendered script).

Validation approach (recommended operationally):
1. Validate representative URLs in Google Rich Results Test.
2. Validate full schema syntax in Schema Markup Validator.
3. Re-check after product/custom-field schema changes (price, availability, canonical override).
4. Track Search Console enhancement coverage for Product/Organization schema warnings.
5. Follow release gate checklist in `/Users/terry/keypad-store/docs/seo/structured-data-release-checklist.md`.

## Priority Actions

1. Completed: explicit canonical alternates added to remaining static marketing pages.
2. Completed: structured-data QA release gate documented in `/Users/terry/keypad-store/docs/seo/structured-data-release-checklist.md`.
3. Completed: programmatic SEO architecture + safeguards delivered in strategy/spec docs.
