Vendure Storefront Essential Pages Status
Generated: 2026-02-10 (local)

Page Path | Purpose | Current Status
/cart | Shopping Cart: View items, adjust quantities, and see the order summary. | Exists (Implemented)
/checkout | Checkout Process: Collect shipping address, payment details, and confirm the order. | Exists (Implemented with Vendure checkout mutations)
/account | Customer Profile: View order history, manage addresses, and account settings. | Exists
/login | Authentication: Sign in via email or Google. | Exists
/order/[code] | Order Confirmation: The "Thank You" page shown after a successful purchase. | Exists

Implementation Notes
1. /cart supports quantity increment/decrement and line removal via /api/cart/update-line.
2. /checkout uses server-side Vendure flow: setCustomerForOrder, setOrderShippingAddress, setOrderBillingAddress, setOrderShippingMethod, transitionOrderToState (if needed), addPaymentToOrder.
3. /order/[code] is live and displays confirmation details (order code, payment method hint).
4. Google auth routes are present (/api/auth/google and /api/auth/google/callback); Google Console credentials are still required.

Relevant New/Updated Routes
- /api/cart/active
- /api/cart/update-line
- /api/checkout/session
- /api/checkout/submit
- /checkout
- /order/[code]

Health Check Update
Generated: 2026-02-11 (local)

Validation Results
1. pnpm --filter ./apps/storefront lint -> PASS (ESLint clean)
2. pnpm -C apps/storefront build -> PASS (Next.js 16 build + typecheck + route generation)
3. pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=high -> PASS (No known vulnerabilities found)
4. Legacy Header import scan -> PASS (no matches for old `Header.tsx` import paths)

Checkout API Notes
- /api/checkout/submit now returns structured error payloads: { error, errorCode, step }.
- Route preserves Vendure session cookie via `withSessionCookie(...)` after mutation flow.
- Flow confirmed: setCustomerForOrder -> setOrderShippingAddress -> setOrderBillingAddress -> eligibleShippingMethods/setOrderShippingMethod -> nextOrderStates/transitionOrderToState (if available) -> addPaymentToOrder.
