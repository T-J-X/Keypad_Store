Storefront Transaction Smoke Test Results
Date: 2026-02-11
Run context: Frontend http://localhost:3001, Backend http://localhost:3000

Goal
- Validate live path: add to cart -> active cart -> checkout submit -> order confirmation route.

Checks performed
1. Reachability
- GET http://localhost:3001/ -> 200
- GET http://localhost:3000/health -> 200

2. Product + country resolution
- Product variant resolved from Shop API: variant id 14 (slug: gaxzard)
- Available enabled country resolved from Shop API: GB

3. Cart add flow
- POST /api/cart/add-item -> 200
- Response ok: true
- Returned order code: ZLURD2SY6YF2QGT3

4. Active cart verification
- GET /api/cart/active -> 200
- totalQuantity: 1
- lines: 1

5. Checkout submit
- POST /api/checkout/submit -> 400
- Error payload:
  {"error":"No eligible shipping methods are available for this order.","errorCode":"NO_ELIGIBLE_SHIPPING_METHODS","step":"set-shipping-method"}

Configuration diagnostics (Admin API)
- Login as superadmin succeeded.
- shippingMethods totalItems: 0
- paymentMethods totalItems: 1 (code: test)

Conclusion
- Storefront cart/session wiring is functioning.
- Checkout orchestration route is functioning and correctly returns structured Vendure error codes.
- Transaction completion is currently blocked by environment/channel configuration: no shipping methods exist.

What is needed to pass full transactional checkout
1. Create at least one Shipping Method in Vendure Admin.
2. Ensure Shipping Method checker/zones make it eligible for the current channel and country (GB in this environment).
3. Re-run the same smoke path.
